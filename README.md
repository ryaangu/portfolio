### ü§ì T(o-d)o ‚Äî A simple To-do list project inspired by [Trello](https://trello.com/)
The initial idea of this project was to learn the very basic parts of developing a website using technologies such as:

**Back-end (C#)**
- ASP.NET (for the core)
- MySQL (for the database)
- Swagger (for the API's documentation)
- xUnit (for the API's testing)

**Front-end (TypeScript)**
- Next.js (for the core)
- React.js (for the rendering)
- Axios (for the connection with the back-end)
