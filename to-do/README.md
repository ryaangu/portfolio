# 🤓 T(o-d)o — A simple To-do list project inspired by [Trello](https://trello.com/)
The initial idea of this project was to learn the very basic parts of developing a website using technologies such as:

**Back-end**
- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/csharp) _(the main programming language)_
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) _(for the compiler)_
- [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) _(for the core)_
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) _(for the database)_
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) _(for the API's documentation)_
- [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) _(for the API's testing)_

**Front-end**
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) _(the main programming language)_
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) _(for the runtime)_
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) _(for the core)_
- [React](https://react.dev/) _(for the rendering)_
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) _(for the HTTP's requests)_

# 💡 Ideas
Since I've said in the previous [README](https://github.com/ryaangu/portfolio), I love to put my creativity in my projects,\
so here's some of the ideas I chose for this one:
### 1. Getting away from e-mails..
I've chose to use [X (previously Twitter)](https://x.com)-like user naming convention, so instead of typing looong e-mails to\
log-in, we can just use something like **@ryan**! Beautiful, right? 🤩
### 2. Ew.. Long passwords!
Yeah, here in this project we don't like typing looong words and this also counts for passwords!\
Instead we're using the famous 4-digits only PINs 💪
> [!CAUTION]
> Obviously this is not a safe alternative, but since this is just a project for learning purposes.. We can use it 😎
